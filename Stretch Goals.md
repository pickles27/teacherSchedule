Stretch Goals:

- Home page would include some sort of account creation, which would allow the app to be useful to different users.

- User authentication / authorization
	- for purposes of time, teacherId / teacherName are hardcoded

- Currently, functionality to add classes is supported, but not edit/delete. These would need to be added to the app.
